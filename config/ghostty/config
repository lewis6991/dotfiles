# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.

# The named font style to use for each of the requested terminal font styles.
# This looks up the style based on the font style string advertised by the
# font itself. For example, "Iosevka Heavy" has a style of "Heavy".
#
# You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style. If you set
# the value of the configuration below to literal `false` then that font style
# will be disabled. If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled
# font style, the regular font style will be used instead.

# These are only valid if its corresponding font-family is also specified. If
# no font-family is specified, then the font-style is ignored unless you're

# font features. You can NOT set multiple font features with a single value
# (yet).
#
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
#
# A valid value is the name of a feature. Prefix the feature with a `-` to
# explicitly disable it. Example: `ss20` or `-ss20`.
#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
#
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt`, `-liga`, and `-dlig` (as
# separate repetitive entries in your config).

# A repeatable configuration to set one or more font variations values for
# a variable font. A variable font is a single font, usually with a filename
# ending in `-VF.ttf` or `-VF.otf` that contains one or more configurable axes
# for things such as weight, slant, etc. Not all fonts support variations;
# only fonts that explicitly state they are variable fonts will work.
#
# The format of this is `id=value` where `id` is the axis identifier. An axis
# identifier is always a 4 character string, such as `wght`. To get the list
# of supported axes, look at your font documentation or use a font inspection
# tool.
#
# Invalid ids and values are usually ignored. For example, if a font only
# supports weights from 100 to 700, setting `wght=800` will do nothing (it
# will not be clamped to 700). You must consult your font's documentation to
# see what values are supported.

# codepoint or a range. Codepoints must be specified as full Unicode
# hex values, such as `U+ABCD`. Codepoints ranges are specified as
# `U+ABCD-U+DEFG`. You can specify multiple ranges for the same font separated
# by commas, such as `U+ABCD-U+DEFG,U+1234-U+5678=fontname`. The font name is
# the same value as you would use for `font-family`.

# All of the configurations behavior adjust various metrics determined by the
# font. The values can be integers (1, -1, etc.) or a percentage (20%, -15%,
# etc.). In each case, the values represent the amount to change the original
# value.
#
# For example, a value of `1` increases the value by 1; it does not set it to
# literally 1. A value of `20%` increases the value by 20%. And so on.
#
# There is little to no validation on these values so the wrong values (i.e.
# `-100%`) can cause the terminal to be unusable. Use with caution and reason.
#
# Some values are clamped to minimum or maximum values. This can make it
# appear that certain values are ignored. For example, the underline position
# is clamped to the height of a cell. If you set the underline position so
# high that it extends beyond the bottom of the cell size, it will be clamped
# to the bottom of the cell.
#
# `adjust-cell-height` has some additional behaviors to describe:
#
#   * The font will be centered vertically in the cell.
#

# The default value is `unicode` which uses the Unicode standard to determine
# grapheme width. This results in correct grapheme width but may result in
# cursor-desync issues with some programs (such as shells) that may use a
# legacy method such as `wcswidth`.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `legacy` - Use a legacy method to determine grapheme width, such as
#     wcswidth This maximizes compatibility with legacy programs but may result
#     in incorrect grapheme width for certain graphemes such as skin-tone
#     emoji, non-English characters, etc.
#
#     This is called "legacy" and not something more specific because the
#     behavior is undefined and we want to retain the ability to modify it.
#     For example, we may or may not use libc `wcswidth` now or in the future.
#
#   * `unicode` - Use the Unicode standard to determine grapheme width.
#
# If a running program explicitly enables terminal mode 2027, then `unicode`
# width will be forced regardless of this configuration. When mode 2027 is

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will

#
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
#
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
#
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
#
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for

# certain size to fit within the grid. There is nothing Ghostty will do about
# this, but it will make an effort.
#
# This will not affect new tabs, splits, or other nested terminal elements.
# This only affects the initial window size of any new window. Changing this
# value will not affect the size of the window after it has been created. This
# is only used for the initial size.
#
# BUG: On Linux with GTK, the calculated window size will not properly take
# into account window decorations. As a result, the grid dimensions will not
# exactly match this configuration. If window decorations are disabled (see
# window-decorations), then this will work as expected.

# Whether to enable saving and restoring window state. Window state includes
# their position, size, tabs, splits, etc. Some window state requires shell
# integration, such as preserving working directories. See `shell-integration`
# for more information.
#
# There are three valid values for this configuration:
#
#   * `default` will use the default system behavior. On macOS, this
#     will only save state if the application is forcibly terminated
#     or if it is configured systemwide via Settings.app.
#
#   * `never` will never save window state.
#
#   * `always` will always save window state whenever Ghostty is exited.
#
# If you change this value to `never` while Ghostty is not running, the next
# Ghostty launch will NOT restore the window state.
#
# If you change this value to `default` while Ghostty is not running and the
# previous exit saved state, the next Ghostty launch will still restore the
# window state. This is because Ghostty cannot know if the previous exit was
# due to a forced save or not (macOS doesn't provide this information).
#
# If you change this value so that window state is saved while Ghostty is not
# running, the previous window state will not be restored because Ghostty only
# saves state on exit if this is enabled.
#
# The default value is `default`.
#
# This is currently only supported on macOS. This has no effect on Linux.
# window-save-state = default

# Resize the window in discrete increments of the focused surface's cell size.
# If this is disabled, surfaces are resized in pixel increments. Currently
# only supported on macOS.
# window-step-resize = false

# Whether to allow programs running in the terminal to read/write to the
# system clipboard (OSC 52, for googling). The default is to allow clipboard
# reading after prompting the user and allow writing unconditionally.

# Trims trailing whitespace on data that is copied to the clipboard. This does
# not affect data sent to the clipboard via `clipboard-write`.

# If true, bracketed pastes will be considered safe. By default, bracketed
# pastes are considered safe. "Bracketed" pastes are pastes while the running
# program has bracketed paste mode enabled (a setting set by the running
# program, not the terminal emulator).
# clipboard-paste-bracketed-safe = true

# The total amount of bytes that can be used for image data (i.e. the Kitty
# image protocol) per terminal scren. The maximum value is 4,294,967,295
# (4GiB). The default is 320MB. If this is set to zero, then all image
# protocols will be disabled.
#
# This value is separate for primary and alternate screens so the effective
# limit per surface is double.
# image-storage-limit = 320000000

# Whether to automatically copy selected text to the clipboard. `true` will
# only copy on systems that support a selection clipboard.
#
# The value `clipboard` will copy to the system clipboard, making this work on
# macOS. Note that middle-click will also paste from the system clipboard in
# this case.
#
# Note that if this is disabled, middle-click paste will also be disabled.
# copy-on-select = true

# The time in milliseconds between clicks to consider a click a repeat
# (double, triple, etc.) or an entirely new single click. A value of zero will

# Additional configuration files to read. This configuration can be repeated
# to read multiple configuration files. Configuration files themselves can

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:
#
#   * Working directory reporting so new tabs, splits inherit the
#     previous terminal's working directory.
#
#   * Prompt marking that enables the "jump_to_prompt" keybinding.
#
#   * If you're sitting at a prompt, closing a terminal will not ask
#     for confirmation.
#
#   * Resizing the window with a complex prompt usually paints much
#     better.
#
# Allowable values are:
#
#   * `none` - Do not do any automatic injection. You can still manually
#     configure your shell to enable the integration.
#
#   * `detect` - Detect the shell based on the filename.
#
#   * `bash`, `fish`, `zsh` - Use this specific shell injection scheme.
#
# The default value is `detect`.
# shell-integration = detect

# Shell integration features to enable if shell integration itself is enabled.
# The format of this is a list of features to enable separated by commas. If
# you prefix a feature with `no-` then it is disabled. If you omit a feature,
# its default value is used, so you must explicitly disable features you don't
# want.
#
# Available features:
#
#   * `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.
#
#   * `sudo` - Set sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.
#
#   * `title` - Set the window title via shell integration.
#
# Example: `cursor`, `no-cursor`, `sudo`, `no-sudo`, `title`, `no-title`
shell-integration-features = cursor,no-sudo,title


# If true, allows the "KAM" mode (ANSI mode 2) to be used within
# the terminal. KAM disables keyboard input at the request of the
# application. This is not a common feature and is not recommended
# to be enabled. This will not be documented further because
# if you know you need KAM, you know. If you don't know if you
# need KAM, you don't need it.
# vt-kam-allowed = false


# If anything other than false, fullscreen mode on macOS will not use the
# native fullscreen, but make the window fullscreen without animations and
# using a new space. It's faster than the native fullscreen mode since it
# doesn't use animations.
#
# Warning: tabs do not work with a non-native fullscreen window. This
# can be fixed but is looking for contributors to help. See issue #392.
#
# Allowable values are:
#
#   * `visible-menu` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, keep the menu bar visible
#   * `true` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, hide the menu bar
#   * `false` - Use native macOS fullscreeen
#
# macos-non-native-fullscreen = false

# If `true`, places the tab bar in the titlebar for tabbed windows.
#
# When this is true, the titlebar will also always appear even when
# fullscreen (native fullscreen) with only one tab. This is not considered
# a bug but if you'd like to improve this behavior then I'm open to it and
# please contribute to the project.
#
# This option intercepts the native tab bar view from macOS and forces it to use
# different positioning. Because of this, it might be buggy or break entirely if
# macOS changes the way its native tab bar view is constructed or managed.
# This has been tested on macOS 14.
#
# For macOS 13 users: saved window state will not restore tabs correctly
# if this is enabled. macOS 14 does not have this issue.
#
# This option only applies to new windows when changed.

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).

# from working properly. https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13211 fixes this.
